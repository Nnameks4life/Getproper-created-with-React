                We can let loose and talk about plants all the time, which is
                something I can't do in real life to all my non-planty friends.
                And every time I give or receive something on here it feels kind
                of like Christmas to me

                This app is cool because I can check with the people in the same
                area where I live. The interaction through the app is easier
                because they will know that I will only ask about plants.

                I love it! I see a ton more plants on the map just this week.
                Glad more people are trying it out. I found out about it in a
                plant exchange FB group and a bunch of people loved it too

                This is such a brilliant idea. Super excited to see it take off.
                I'm really loving what you've created. I'm pacing myself and
                only adding a few plants every day ðŸ˜‚

                Really like the idea behind it, I do some trading and sending of
                plants through the mail via fb groups but it's nice to have
                designated place and searchable if you are looking for a
                specific plant.

                One of the FB groups I belong to posted the link. Just the kind
